# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block for code. Functions are mainly used to write the code that can be repetative in a program.
  for example, logging the elements in an array. To log every element in an array, a function can be used so that it can be reused 
  for every array or string in your program. 
  
  Researched answer: A function is a subprogram that can be called by code external or internal to the function. A function is 
  composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.
  The parameters of a function call are the function's arguments. Arguments are passed to functions by value.


2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: push() , pop() , shift() , unshift() , reverse()

  Researched answer: join() , splice() , concat() , sort() , forEach()



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() is used to log the output in a console, while return is used to return the variable from the function.
  Statement in return will not be logged on the console. console.log() is used to log the return variable.

  Researched answer: 
  The main purpose of the return is a statement that allows a function to output a value back to where it was called.
  Return statements are usually used in functions to return some sort of value.
  The console.log(); is a function that will write the argument value on the console. 
  console.log() does is log something to the web browser's console. It is useful for debugging code.
  


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: A argument is passed in the function. Arguments of a function can be variable , but every variable is not an argument.

  Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  roles:
  Driver: Writes the code
  Navigator: Reviews each line of code as it is typed in.

  Researched answer: Pair programming includes two individuals (developers) working on a single system, with one typing 
  and the other one navigating or observing. Generally the one responsible for typing is known as the ‘Driver’, 
  while the other one called the ‘Navigator’ continually revise and review what is being coded or typed.
  The objective is to share the workload between both the participants in order to maintain the constant development stream and 
  also to help spread knowledge over the team.Ideally both the team members should switch their duties for better results.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript language is used in developing web pages(like google,facebook,bookings.com,etc). 
  It is mainly used for dynamic information. Example, timely updates or news, video content page , updated weather information.
